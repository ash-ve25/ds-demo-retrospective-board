### Setting up client

To simplify testing I put `babel` transformation within `index.html`. This means loading the page
takes longer than required, but also removes the need to setup node and watchers.

To use:

- Run a HTTP server
- Open ds-client/index.html
- Login using:
    username: john / bob
    password: password
- Use!
