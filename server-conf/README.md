### Setting up a server

Installing deepstream is as simple as downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io/releases/latest) from github or installing it on linux via [apt](https://deepstream.io/inst
all/ubuntu/) or [yum](https://deepstream.io/install/centos/).

And finally just start the server via:

```bash
deepstream start -c /<path-to-ds-demo-retrospective-board>/server-conf/config.yml
```
